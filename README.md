# Heap-Allocator
An implicit and explicit implementation of a heap allocator. Programmed in C.
An implicit allocator entails managing free heap space through a first-fit method over the total number of blocks in the heap.
An explicit allocator entails managing free heap space through a first-fit method over the a linked list of free blocks in the heap, optimizing throughput. In addition, the explicit allocator, unlike the implicit, supports coalescing of free blocks and an in-place realloc (also utilizing coalescing) to improve utilization.
The project also includes a test_harness file, which reads and interprets text-based script files (that the user can create and input) containing a sequence of allocator requests. The test_harness runs the allocator and its various functionalities (mymallc, myrealloc, myfree) on a script and validates results (validate_heap) for correctness. When compiled using "make", it will create 3 differentcompiled versions of this program, one using each type of heap allocator (bump, implicit, and explicit). Hope you enjoy!
